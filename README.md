## Sweet's Binary Conversion Tool [v1.0]
Sweet's Binary Conversion Tool is a simple python application that converts characters to Binary.

### Purpose
I created this for my own computer science endeavors. I understand there may be better ways of accomplishing
the task at hand, but it worked for my needs at the time. I may add more features like hex conversion and the ability
to manipulate the data through different mathematical results.

### Usage
Type `python sweets-bct.py` in your Command Line Interface.
You will be prompted to type in the characters you wish to convert.
Once satisfied, press `ENTER` to see the results.

### Contributions
You're free to distribute and modify this code and any improvements or suggestions are welcomed.
